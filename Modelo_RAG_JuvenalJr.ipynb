Fiquem livres para usar qualquer modelo, mas sugerimos os modelos do sentence-transformers. Usem o FAISS para criar e gerenciar o índice.\n",

Their cult centered on three small lakes that emitted sulphurous vapors in the Palagonia plain, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with geysers and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted. The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain; one legend made the Palici the sons of Zeus, or possibly Hephaestus, by Aetna or Thalia, but another claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity Adranus.\\n\", 'links': [{'target': 'Sicily', 'indices': [68, 76]}, {'target': 'Chthonic', 'indices': [77, 85]}, {'target': 'Roman mythology', 'indices': [97, 112]}, {'target': 'Greek mythology', 'indices': [140, 155]}, {'target': 'Ovid', 'indices': [179, 183]}, {'target': 'Virgil', 'indices': [215, 221]}, {'target': 'Palagonia', 'indices': [319, 328]}, {'target': 'Geyser', 'indices': [393, 400]}, {'target': 'Zeus', 'indices': [706, 710]}, {'target': 'Hephaestus', 'indices': [724, 734]}, {'target': 'Aetna (nymph)', 'indices': [739, 744]}, {'target': 'Thalia (nymph)', 'indices': [748, 754]}, {'target': 'Adranus', 'indices': [828, 835]}], 'title': 'Palici'}\n"

It's known from historical records that the Red Army was successful in its operations against Nazi Germany, and by January 1945, Soviet military might was aimed at the German capital of Berlin. This implies that the Red Army was still engaged in combat against the German Army.\n",

Based on [Document 2]: After the summer of 1944, the Red Army continued to push the Germans westwards until they reached the outskirts of Eastern Germany. By January 1945, Soviet military might was aimed at the German capital of Berlin. By [Document 3]: By the summer of 1944 the German Wehrmacht is increasingly in retreat, suggesting the German forces were suffering defeats, it can be inferred that by the time the Battle of Berlin occurred which left the Red Army still engaged in combat Nazi Germany was losing the war. Considering that the Battle for Berlin fell to the Red Army in May 1945 \n",
            "\n",

Provinces receive their powers from the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly called the British North America Act, 1867), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada. Additionally, provinces are considered sovereign within certain areas, have a lieutenant governor as their representative, and are responsible for various social programs like healthcare, education, and welfare. In contrast, territories have no inherent sovereignty, have a commissioner rather than a lieutenant governor, and receive powers directly from the federal government.\n",
